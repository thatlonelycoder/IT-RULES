                This website was created for the purpose of letting people know how amazing IT is. 
        Computer Science like the name suggest has to do with the study of computers and their functions.
        Learning how to code and explore the virtual world is simply facinating and if you are someone like
        me who likes to be alone IT is the best thing for you to develop an interest in. Computer science is all about understanding and harnessing the power of computers.
         It's like exploring the inner workings of these machines and using that knowledge to create amazing things. üñ•üí°

In simple terms, computer science is the study of how computers work and how we can use them to solve problems.
 It's like learning the language of computers and using that language to make them do cool stuff.

Imagine you have a problem that needs solving. Computer science helps you break down that problem into 
smaller pieces and come up with a step-by-step plan to solve it. This plan is called an algorithm. It's like a recipe that tells the computer what to do.

Coding is a big part of computer science. It's like writing instructions for the computer to follow. 
You use programming languages like Python or Java to write these instructions. It's like talking to the computer and telling it what to do.

Computer science also covers other exciting areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data analysis. These fields help us build smarter machines, 
protect our digital information, and make sense of big data.

So, computer science is about exploring the world of computers, solving problems, and creating amazing things uswing technology. 
It's a field full of possibilities and opportunities. If you're interested in computers and love solving puzzles, computer science might be the perfect fit for¬†you!¬†üòäüë©‚Äçüíª
So, this website was intitially going to be about how much I (the creator), hates physics but then i realise that instead to talking about what i hate
 it would be better to talk about the best and most facinating thing ever.
I know a lot of people may disaggree with me but everyone has they're own interest and that's cool too, but IT rules.
